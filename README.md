## 🚀 Overview

RAGMine is a revolutionary extension to Redmine that transforms the proven project management platform into a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) source for modern AI applications. By leveraging 20 years of Redmine's stability and adding cutting-edge vector search capabilities, RAGMine bridges the gap between traditional knowledge management and AI-powered workflows.

## 🤝 Integration with DevOpsZealot

RAGMine integrates seamlessly with [DevOpsZealot](https://github.com/your-org/devops-zealot) to provide context-aware autonomous coding:

```python
# DevOpsZealot automatically receives RAG context
issue = mcp.execute_tool("redmine-get-issue-intelligent", {"issue_id": 123})
# Returns issue with similar solutions, patterns, and team conventions
```

Success rates improve from ~72% to ~94% with RAG-enhanced context!
